**The Pillars:**
1.  **Onboarding**: The First Step. Time-to-Value.
2.  **Engagement**: Building Habits. Daily/Weekly Use.
3.  **Retention & Winback**: Preventing Churn & Resurrecting Users.

## Slide 3: Stage 1 - Onboarding
**Headline:** The First Step: Time-to-Value
**Context:** First impressions matter. This is where you make sure users understand the value of your app and the benefits of upgrading to a paid plan.
**Objective:** Completion of high value actions (e.g. 0/4 completed Sign up, Install, Play 1 Song, Use sharing feature)

**Best Practices:**
*   **Product-led first:** Use in-app guides and marketing comms to drive the "Aha!" moment. Think of Slack's onboarding process as an example. The app should guide you through all essential features once you log in. Emails are secondary at this stage.
*   **Define "Onboarded":** What action must they take? (e.g., "Installed the app, "Played 1 Song" and "Used sharing feature"). These high value actions are the ones that will act as key metrics to measure the success of onboarding.
*   **Early Awareness:** Don't hide Paid features. Show them what they *could* have. This will help them understand the value of the app and the benefits of upgrading to a paid plan and can be critical ro prevent early churn. According to RevenueCat (2025 State of Subscription Apps (link), optimizing early engagement is the #1 factor for success.

**Email Examples:**
*   **Email 1 (Quick overview on onboarding flow):**
    *   *Subject:* Welcome to [App]!
    *   *Body:* Here is everything you need to get started. 
*   **Email 2 (Feature Tease - Paid):**
    *   *Subject:* Did you know?
    *   *Body:* Premium members can [Benefit]. You're on the free plan, but you can try this feature for 24h to see what you're missing.
*   **Email 3 (The Setup Nudge):**
    *   *Subject:* You're 80% there!
    *   *Body:* You've created your account, but you haven't [Setup Step]. Complete it now to unlock your personalized dashboard.

## Slide 4: Stage 2 - Engagement
**Headline:** Building the Relationship
**Context:** Once onboarded, the goal is habit formation. Move them from "trying it out" to "part of my routine."
**Objective:** Engagement level increase (e.g. Occassional user -> Daily active user)

**Tactics:**
*   **Value Recap:** Remind them what they're getting (e.g., "You saved 2 hours this week").
*   **Education:** Help them master the tool. Power users don't churn.
*   **Community:** Connect them with other users to deepen investment.

**Email Examples:**
*   **Email 1 (Weekly Report):**
    *   *Subject:* Your activity for the week
    *   *Body:* **12 Tasks Completed**. You're on a 3-week streak! Log in to keep it up.
*   **Email 2 ("Did you know?"):**
    *   *Subject:* Most people don't know you can [Advanced Tip].
    *   *Body:* It's a game changer for [Result]. Watch this 30s video to learn how.
*   **Email 3 (The "Hidden Gem" Feature):**
    *   *Subject:* We noticed you haven't tried **[Feature X]** yet.
    *   *Body:* It's one of our most popular tools. Give it a spin next time you log in.

## Slide 5: Stage 3 - Retention & Winback
**Headline:** Keep the customers
**Context:** Retention is about stopping churn *before* it happens. Winback is about right-timing the return *after* they leave.
**Objective:** Improvement of churn (e.g. Churn rate from 3.5% --> 3.2%

**Defence Strategy:**
*   **Risk Signals:** Identify drops in usage early. Intervene with support, not offers.
*   **Offers:** This is where you use offers to prevent customer from churning. Good companies will calculate the cost of new customer acquisition and retention and pragmatically use discounts to prevent customer from churning. 
*   **Loyalty:** Reward tenure (like Duolingo Streaks or Anniversary badges).


**Email Examples:**
*   **Email 1 (The Risk Signal - Retention):**
    *   *Subject:* We've missed you!
    *   *Body:* You haven't logged in for a while. Here's what is new in the app. Discover more ways to get value. Is something blocking you? Reply to this email and let our support team help you get back on track.
*   **Email 2 (The "We've Changed" - Winback):**
    *   *Subject:* It's been a while, [Name].
    *   *Body:* Since you left, we launched **[Major Feature]**. We hope it will convince you to come back. 
*   **Email 3 (The Welcome Back Offer):**
    *   *Subject:* Ready to try again?
    *   *Body:* Come back today and get **50% off** your first 2 months. Code: **COMEBACK50**.

## Slide 6: Bonus - Monetisation
**Headline:** Monetising the Relationship
**Context:** Monetisation isn't just "buy now." It's about matching price to value. Think like Spotify: demonstrate value, then offer the upgrade.

**Strategies:**
*   **The "Spotify" Model:** Show free users exactly what they are missing (ads, offline mode) in context.
*   **Annual Upgrades:** Move monthly subscribers to annual plans to secure cash flow and reduce churn.
*   **Cross-sell:** Suggest add-ons only *after* specific core actions are habitual.

**Email Examples:**
*   **Email 1 (The Upsell - Contextual):**
    *   *Subject:* Tired of interruptions?
    *   *Body:* You listened to 50 hours of music this month. Imagine how much better that would be with **Zero Ads**. Try Premium free for 7 days.
*   **Email 2 (The Annual Switch):**
    *   *Subject:* Switch to Annual today and pay just $90.
    *   *Body:* That's **3 months free** just for clicking a button.
*   **Email 3 (The Cross-sell):**
    *   *Subject:* You've mastered [Core Product].
    *   *Body:* Did you know you can also manage [Related Task] with our **Pro Add-on**? It integrates perfectly with your current workflow.
